This Is my game Marshland! Marshland is an FPS game that takes place in a marshland. Im mostly going to use this as an atmosphere demo, but im also going to try and get some core mechanics and make them scalable if I can :)

wasd to move

left click to shoot

esc for pause menu

there isnt really a gameplay loop right now, but I think it shows the atmosphere I was trying to capture, so in the future I will work on fleshing out gameplay :)
